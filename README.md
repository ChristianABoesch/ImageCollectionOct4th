Here is a webpage containing a random assortment of Stable Diffusion's hand-drawn sketch interpretations.

Questions:
1. Would it be okay to reuse questions that haven't been answered yet, or should I just keep thinking of more? Since I am doing these daily, I figure I'm gonna be all out of decent questions at a certain point.
2. How could I make the text inside a button change color when I click on the button?
